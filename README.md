# BloodBankManagementSystem
This project is part of my academic subject Software Engineering. In this, my team and I created a website to manage and regulate blood supply between the blood banks and the hospitals, It provides a great interface for the blood donors and receivers. This website is created with sole purpose of promoting blood donation for the need of our society.

We used PHP, HTML, CSS3, Bootstrap for developing Fornt and Backend development.
For storing data in the database, MySQL was used.

Features of this system:
- Hospitals can:
      put request for the blood type they need
      - check status of their request
- Blood Banks can:
      repond to requests of the hospitals and receivers
      - update the status(availibity) of different blood types\
      - provide donors with location and date of donation
- Donors can:
      register for blood donation
      - donate blood to banks on given date and specified venue
- Receicers can:
      register for receiving blood
      - put request for blood
